1. INTRODUCTION

nothing here yet

2. INSTALLATION

There is a simple makefile provided, run 'make && make install' to compile 
and install the plugin under /usr/lib/audacious/General/. 

Change the path in Makefile to install under a non-standard directory. 

Arch Linux users can install it from AUR:

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=61123

This plugin depends on GTK+ 3.2 or later and Audacious 3.3. 

3. TODO

At this point, I'm not using this plugin much, so it is not likely to be developed it any further.

4. CONTACTS

You can reach me at rustam.tsurik@gmail.com should you have any questions,
bug reports, suggestions on how to improve the plugin, etc.

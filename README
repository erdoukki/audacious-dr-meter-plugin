1. INTRODUCTION

nothing here yet

2. INSTALLATION

There is a simple makefile provided, run 'make && make install' to compile 
and install the plugin under /usr/lib/audacious/General/. 

Change the path in Makefile to install under a non-standard directory. 

Arch Linux users can install it from AUR:

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=61123

This plugin depends on GTK+ 3.2 or later and Audacious 3.3. 

3. TODO

The next things that may need attention are:

 - put processing to a separate thread, the window is currently unresponsive 
   while DR is being calculated, so it needs to be separated from GUI.
 - improve GUI: add sorting by a specific column(artist/title/DR/..), 
   probably move the progress bar to the top, etc.
 - add some configurable options to the 'Preferences' window.
 - implement the album mode, i.e. when all tracks that belong to the same 
   album are recognized as a single track and DR is calculated for the entire 
   album.
